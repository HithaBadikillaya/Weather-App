# WEATHER APP

Weather Explorer is a modern web application that showcases real-time weather updates in a visually engaging way. The landing page features a rotating 3D model (using Three.js) along with an animated title and a call-to-action button to view detailed weather data.

# Tech Stack Used

React – Core front-end library for building the user interface.
React Router – Handles client-side navigation (e.g., from the landing page to the weather page).
React Three Fiber (built on Three.js) – Renders the 3D model in the browser, allowing for animations and transformations.
Styled Components / CSS – Custom styling for the layout, typography, and animations.
SplitText – A custom/third-party library for animating text letter by letter.
Weather API – Provides the real-time weather data displayed in the application.
By combining React’s component-based architecture with the 3D rendering capabilities of Three.js (via React Three Fiber), Weather Explorer offers an immersive, interactive experience for checking the weather.
